# LabInventoryUWCUSA
This project is dedicated to my late teacher Hritik Sampat who never ceased to push me to my limit. This is my first complex java program I have developed on my own with the guidance from my Computer Science teacher at UWC-USA.

## Overview
This application is a working prototype Inventory application customized for UWC-USA's Science Laboratory. This inventory is a great way to keep record of lab equipments in the inventory, update, search, and delete specfic equipments, etc.
